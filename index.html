        <p>The basic purpose of the project was to remove the manual attendance  registers with digital attendance registers to bring flexibility and improve the way of taking the attendance record. Our motive was:
1.     To remove the lengthy manual way of taking attendance and give the faculty an efficient and simple way of doing the same
2.     To help them have information about every student while taking attendance through this app.
3.     To remove extra work of converting manual records into digital format and upload it to ERP software.
4.     To provide an offline accessibility to the app that allows you to take attendance offline and sync it when internet is available.</p>

<p>Brief introduction:</p>

<p>Datawind made it possible for us to design such software to fulfill all the purposes mentioned above by funding and providing Akash tablets that has been used to develop the app.
The app is capable of providing a simple interface to take attendance of students and upload or export it to our server or Google drive.</p>

<p>The app has many features including:
1.     There are two operational modes [offline and online]
2.     We can create student and class records manually using the same app
3.      App provides all the student info including the picture of the student.
4.     We can export the attendance records in csv format or directly upload it to Google drive.</p>
